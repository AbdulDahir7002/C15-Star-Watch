# API Exploration

The scripts in this directory were used to understand the APIs that were selected for this project, and as examples of how to use them. They are not necessary for the project as a whole to function.

## Requirements

All requirements are listed in requirements.txt, but the requirements for this folder specifically are:

- python-dotenv

## Setup Instructions

Use ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

A ```.env``` file containing a variable ```ASTRONOMY_BASIC_AUTH_KEY``` is required. Go to the [astronomy API](https://astronomyapi.com/ ) website to create an account and get your key.

The python scripts can now be ran.
